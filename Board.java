
/**
 * Interface for an Abalone (lite) game.
 *
 * A human plays against the machine. The human's ground lines are always the
 * lowest rows, whereas the ground lines of the machine are the highest rows.
 * The human plays from bottom to top, the machine from top to bottom. The user
 * with the black balls opens the game. Winner is who first pushes
 * out/eliminates six of the opponent's balls.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are some differences to traditional Abalone:
 * <ul>
 * <li>In case that one player has no option to make a valid move, he must miss
 *     a turn. The other player can make a move in any case.
 * <li>A move can involve more than three (own) balls.
 * <li>Sideward moves, i.e., changing the diagonal of more than one own ball not
 *     in the same row, are not allowed.
 * <li>The game may never end.
 * </ul>
